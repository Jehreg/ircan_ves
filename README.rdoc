= IRCan Virtual Machine Administration Web App

Author:: Patrick Naubert
Contributors:: Simon Deziel

== Requirements

Python-Django version 1.1.1+
Sqlite3
MochiKit 1.4.2+

== Limitations

This webapp MUST communicate with the IRCan servers with valid SSH keys. Since I do not want to store these keys here, and also this code is under development, I elected to login to the webapp platform with my valid admin credentials. I then manually start the webapp.  This permits the webapp to talk to the IRCan infra as me.  This means the webapp stops when I close my terminal window.

I will change this method when we get closer to Prod-level.
